            <h2>Why was PN Shah the founder and an icon of independence in Nepal?</h2>
            <p>
                Shah, the founder of the ‘greater’ Nepal, was born in 1723 in Gorkha as the first son of King Nara Bhupal Shah and his second wife, Queen Kaushalyawati. All his life, he was determined in his quest to extend his territory and he did not consider any type of relations seriously rather used them solely for the fulfillment of the purpose.</h2>

                No matter how cruel or strict Prithvi Narayan Shah was, it was this cruelty as well as his courage that made him able to fulfill his wish to unite the small kingdoms and create a greater Nepal. He was also responsible for developing the feeling of unity in diversity among the people of Nepal as he considered Nepal as the garden of four caste and 36 sub-castes.

                Although he gave most of his time to the expansion of his territory, he also laid out the guidelines for governance, nationalism and foreign policy in his Divya Upadesh (Divine Advice). He laid out nine principles which formed the foundation of Nepali political and national life.

                King Prithvi Narayan Shah breathed his last at Devighat on the bank of the Trishuli river in Nuwakot on January 11, 1775.
                After his death, his eldest son Pratap Singh Shah continued the unification campaign and conquered Chitwan. But, he died soon. After that, his son Rana Bahadur Shah ascended the throne. He was a minor then; hence, his mother  Rajendra Laxmi took the state power in her hand as a regent and gave continuity to the unification campaign. She annexed Lamjung, Tanahun and Kaski belonging to Chubise Rajya (the group of 24 states) into the Kingdom of Nepal from 1777 to 1785.
