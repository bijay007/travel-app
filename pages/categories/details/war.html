            <p>Prithvi Nārāyaṇ’s initial attempts to establish hegemony over the three Malla kingdoms were abortive,however; the raja of Kāthmāndu enlisted the aid of the East India Company in 1767 and was able to repulse Prithvi Nārāyaṇ’s encroachments. Two years later, however, after the company’s forces had been recalled, Kāthmāndu was taken. This allowed Prithvi Nārāyaṇ to consolidate his territories into a new “Kingdom of Nepal,” which he made into a unified, strong, and independent state.

                He then annexed Tarai, Kumāon, Garhwāl, Simla, and Sikkim in northern India, as well as large portions of the Plateau of Tibet and of the valleys of the Inner Himalayas. By conquering Makwānpur, however, he brought down upon himself the combined military forces of the East India Company and the nawab of Bengal, who together succeeded in retaking that area. Nepal at that time extended from the Punjab to Sikkim and was almost twice as large in land area as it is today.

                He had successfully extended his territory to Darjeeling, now in India and while he was planning an attack on Sikkim, he fell sick. His health worsened and he died at the age of 56. Although he gave most of his time to the expansion of his territory, he also laid out the guidelines for governance, nationalism and foreign policy in his Divya Upadesh (Divine Advice). He laid out nine principles which formed the foundation of Nepali political and national life.
