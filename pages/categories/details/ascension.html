            <h3>A king by luck</h3>
            <p>
                As the eldest son of King Nara Bhupal Shah, Prithvi Narayan Shah was the crown prince and heir to the throne of Gorkha. But, it is believed that Brinda Keshar Shah, the son of King Nara Bhupal Shah and another queen Buddhimati, got on the womb first. But, Prithvi Narayan Shah was born earlier in the seventh month of his mother’s pregnancy.
            </p>
            <p>
                This created a huge discussion among the people regarding the selection of the crown prince of the state. The final decision was at King Nara Bhupal Shah’s discretion.

                As the decision was yet to be made, Brinda Keshar Shah died when he was around seven years old.He ascended the throne of Gorkha after the death of his father in 1799 BS at the age of 20.
